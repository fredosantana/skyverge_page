  <h2>A Day In the Life</h2>
      <p><blockquote>"Thank you for your email! While we do not offer a live image preview feature at this time, I'll speak to our development team to implement this feature. I'll keep you posted once I hear from them."</blockquote></p>
  <h2>Fire Alarm</h2>
  <p>First I'll scan through the first ten emails to get an idea of what the issue is. Then I'll contact the appropriate individual/team in order to resolve the issue. I will then develop a template response to clients that would first apologize for the issue then assure them the development team are working to resolve it. If there's a web page associated with it, the template response would also be noted on there.</p> 
  <h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
  <p>So there I was browsing at Home Depot where all of a sudden the lights caught my attention. Bluetooth light bulbs to be precise. HD's selection was limited to the usual name brands that typically go for $60 a bulb. Cheaper ones were simply white bulbs.</p>
  <p>Then I decided to check Amazon and found a brand called <a href="https://www.fluxsmartlighting.com/">Flux</a>. This<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flux-Bluetooth-Smart-Light-Generation/dp/B016NVSI7G"> bulb</a> in particular was relatively cheaper than others that have comparable features. Plus the reviews overall were positive so I went ahead and purchased one. It's so simple to use and has so many features that I wound up buying another.</p>
